# Spark, Athena and DuckDB helpers

Phase G pieces for working *alongside* other engines: generate the SQL they need, submit it, and use them as oracles.

| Package | What it does | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| `Iceberg.Net.Spark` | Spark SQL for Iceberg's stored procedures; a PySpark driver that runs a list of statements; EMR Serverless and AWS Glue job runners | exact-SQL unit tests; the Spark 4.0.1 + Iceberg 1.12 oracle image runs a generated script through the driver; runners with the real SDK clients against moto, and the staged job run from moto S3 by Spark on a Glue table in moto (`ManagedSparkJobTests`) |
| `Iceberg.Net.Athena` | Athena SQL for Iceberg DDL/DML (CREATE TABLE, OPTIMIZE, VACUUM, table properties, time travel), its Trino dialect (`TrinoSql`), and a query runner | exact-SQL unit tests; the query SQL run by Trino 478 on our tables (`AthenaSqlOnTrinoTests`); runner with the real SDK client against moto's Athena (`AthenaRunnerEmulationTests`); real Athena only in the AWS-mode `AthenaTests` |
| `interop/duckdb_oracle.py` | DuckDB's `iceberg` extension as a reader of our tables | `DuckDbCrossEngineTests` (skips when the extension cannot load) |

Tests: `dotnet test tests/Iceberg.Net.Ecosystem.Tests` (with `emulation/up.sh --spark` for the Spark oracle and
`ICEBERG_DUCKDB_PYTHON` for DuckDB, see below).

## Spark procedures

```csharp
var procs = new IcebergProcedures("glue");                    // the Spark catalog name
var events = new SparkTable("glue", "analytics", "events");   // or SparkTable.From("glue", tableIdentifier)

procs.RewriteDataFiles(events, new RewriteDataFilesOptions { Where = "event_date >= '2026-10-01'", MinInputFiles = 2 }).ToSql();
// CALL `glue`.system.`rewrite_data_files`(table => '`analytics`.`events`', options => map('min-input-files', '2'),
//      where => 'event_date >= \'2026-10-01\'')
procs.ExpireSnapshots(events, new ExpireSnapshotsOptions { OlderThan = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(-7), RetainLast = 10 });
```

Covered: `rewrite_data_files` (bin-pack, sort, z-order; typed common options plus any `options` entry),
`rewrite_position_delete_files`, `expire_snapshots`, `remove_orphan_files`, `rewrite_manifests`,
`cherrypick_snapshot`, `rollback_to_snapshot`, `rollback_to_timestamp`, `set_current_snapshot` (ID or ref),
`fast_forward`, `publish_changes`, `create_changelog_view`, `add_files`, `register_table`, `ancestors_of`,
`compute_table_stats`; `Call(name, (arg, value)…)` for anything else.

Quoting rules (`SparkSql`):
- Identifiers are **always** back-quoted, a back-quote doubled, so reserved words, hyphens and dots are safe. The
  procedure's `table` argument is the namespace-qualified, back-quoted name **as a string literal**
  (`'`ns`.`t-1`'`), because Spark parses it as a multi-part identifier; it never carries the catalog (the procedure
  runs on its catalog, and a table of another catalog is refused).
- String literals escape `\` and `'` with a backslash (Spark's default parser unescapes them).
- Timestamps are written as `TIMESTAMP '… Z'`, so the session time zone cannot shift `older_than`.
- Maps are `map('k', 'v', …)` in key order; empty option maps and null arguments are left out, so Iceberg's defaults
  apply.
- A `where` / `sort_order` text is SQL the caller writes (it is passed as a literal and parsed by Iceberg). Spark
  evaluates it as an expression, so it is trusted input: never build it from user text. Argument names given to
  `Call` must be plain identifiers.

Things the oracle run taught: `remove_orphan_files` refuses an `older_than` under 24 hours; Java's changelog scan
refuses snapshots with delete files, so `create_changelog_view` works only over append/overwrite history.

### Running a script on EMR Serverless or Glue

```csharp
var stager = new SparkScriptStager(s3FileIO, "s3://ops-bucket/iceberg-jobs/");
var script = new SparkSqlScript()
    .Add(procs.RewriteDataFiles(events))
    .Add(procs.RewritePositionDeleteFiles(events))
    .Add(procs.ExpireSnapshots(events, new() { RetainLast = 20 }));

ISparkSqlJobRunner runner = new EmrServerlessSqlJobRunner(new AmazonEMRServerlessClient(), stager, new EmrServerlessJobOptions
{
    ApplicationId = "00f…", ExecutionRoleArn = "arn:aws:iam::…:role/emr-iceberg", StagingPrefix = "s3://ops-bucket/iceberg-jobs/",
    Spark = SparkCatalogConfig.Glue("glue", "s3://lake/warehouse/"),
});
var run = await runner.RunAsync(script);   // submit, poll, throw SparkJobFailedException unless it succeeded
```

- The **driver** (`Scripts/iceberg_sql_driver.py`, embedded) reads a JSON array of statements, so nothing splits SQL
  on `;`. It is staged once under a content-hash name; each run writes a new `statements/…json`. It prints a
  `@@RESULTS@@` JSON line with every statement's rows (first 100).
- **EMR Serverless**: `StartJobRun` with the driver as `entryPoint`, `--statements <uri>` as arguments, and the catalog
  as `--conf` in `sparkSubmitParameters` (EMR 7.x images ship Iceberg); optional log URI, timeout, tags.
- **Glue**: `GlueSqlJobRunner.EnsureJobAsync` creates (or repoints) a `glueetl` job, Glue 5.0, whose script is the
  driver, with `--datalake-formats iceberg` and the catalog in Glue's single `--conf` argument; each `SubmitAsync` is a
  `StartJobRun` with `--statements`.
- `SparkCatalogConfig`: `Glue`, `Rest` (Polaris, S3 Tables / Glue REST endpoints) and `Hadoop` (tests), always with
  the Iceberg SQL extensions that `CALL` needs.
- `EnsureJobAsync` creates the job, or updates it when its script is not the current driver or this runner's
  arguments (`--datalake-formats`, `--conf`, `--job-language`) differ. Glue's `UpdateJob` overwrites the whole
  definition, so every other setting of the existing job (role, workers, timeout, retries, connections, security
  configuration, execution class, other arguments, …) is sent back unchanged.

**What has run for real.** There is no AWS account in development, so the runners run against moto 5.2.4 with the
real SDK clients (`ManagedSparkJobTests`, emulation target, `emulation/up.sh --spark`):

| Step | EMR Serverless | Glue |
|---|---|---|
| Staging the driver and statements | to moto S3 through `S3FileIO`; read back byte for byte | same |
| Job definition | — (the test creates the application) | `CreateJob` in moto; a second `EnsureJobAsync` makes no call (moto has no `UpdateJob`; the update path is a faked-client test) |
| Submission | `StartJobRun`; moto records entry point, arguments, `sparkSubmitParameters`, log URI, tags | `StartJobRun` with `--statements` |
| Polling | `GetJobRun` (moto: `SUCCESS` at once); `CancelJobRun` then `GetJobRun` reads `CANCELLED` | `GetJobRun` through `STARTING → RUNNING → SUCCEEDED` (moto's state manager, one step per two describes) |
| Execution | `SparkJobServiceEmulator` reads the run back from moto and `spark-submit`s it in `apache/spark:4.0.1`: the driver and statements are fetched from moto S3 over `s3://`, the Glue catalog and S3FileIO talk to moto. `rewrite_data_files` + `expire_snapshots` on a table this library wrote; this library then reads one compacted file, one snapshot, the same rows, fsck clean | same, with Glue's argument handling: default arguments overlaid by the run's, `--conf` as Spark configuration, `--JOB_NAME`/`--JOB_RUN_ID`, and refusal without `--datalake-formats iceberg` |
| Failure | a failing statement fails the job (non-zero exit after `[1/2]`, no results line) | — |

Still only on AWS: the services executing runs themselves (EMR 7.x / Glue 5.0 images, IAM, EMRFS, Glue's own `--conf`
parsing) and run states that reflect what Spark did; Glue `UpdateJob` / `BatchStopJobRun` against the service.

**Spark Connect**: not implemented (experimental). Spark Connect speaks gRPC with Spark's protobuf plan messages;
there is no maintained .NET client, and submitting `CALL` statements through it would need one. The SQL this package
generates works through any Spark SQL endpoint (Connect, Thrift server, Databricks SQL) the caller already has.

## Athena

```csharp
var t = new AthenaTable("analytics", "events");
AthenaSql.CreateTable(t, schema, "s3://lake/analytics/events", spec, new AthenaIcebergProperties { VacuumMaxSnapshotAgeSeconds = 259200 });
AthenaSql.Optimize(t, "event_date >= DATE '2026-10-01'");   // OPTIMIZE "analytics"."events" REWRITE DATA USING BIN_PACK WHERE …
AthenaSql.Vacuum(t);                                         // VACUUM "analytics"."events"
AthenaSql.SetTableProperties(t, new AthenaIcebergProperties { VacuumMinSnapshotsToKeep = 3 });
AthenaSql.Select(t, ["id"], AthenaSql.AsOf(instant));       // … FOR TIMESTAMP AS OF TIMESTAMP '… UTC'
AthenaSql.Select(t, timeTravel: AthenaSql.AsOfVersion(snapshotId));
AthenaSql.MetadataTable(t, "snapshots");                    // "analytics"."events$snapshots"

var athena = new AthenaQueryRunner(new AmazonAthenaClient(), new AthenaQueryOptions { WorkGroup = "primary", Database = "analytics" });
var result = await athena.RunAsync(AthenaSql.Vacuum(t));
```

For restartable work, persist the SQL, token and runner configuration before submitting, then persist the
returned execution ID:

```csharp
var id = await athena.StartAsync(sql, savedClientRequestToken);
// After a restart or local wait timeout: resume this execution, without submitting another query.
var result = await athena.ResumeAsync(id, sql);
```

`AthenaSubmissionUnknownException` carries the request token after ambiguous submission.
`AthenaQueryTimedOutException` carries the execution ID after a local timeout. A terminal
`AthenaQueryFailedException` exposes Athena's `ErrorCategory`, `ErrorType`, `ErrorMessage` and `Retryable` hint;
it does not automatically resubmit SQL. See the [stability and retry design](stability-and-retries.md) for the
distinction between submission recovery, polling and a deliberate new execution.

- **Two quoting dialects**: Athena runs DDL (CREATE/ALTER TABLE) through its Hive parser (back-quotes) and queries,
  `OPTIMIZE` and `VACUUM` through Trino (double quotes, a double quote doubled; string literals with `''`).
- Hive DDL string literals have no escape Athena handles reliably, so locations, comments and property values
  containing quotes, backslashes or control characters are **refused** rather than escaped.
- `CreateTable` maps Iceberg types to Athena DDL (`bigint`, `decimal(p,s)`, `array<…>`, `map<…>`, `struct<…>`, …)
  and partition fields to `year/month/day/hour(col)`, `bucket(n, col)`, `truncate(w, col)`. Types Athena cannot
  declare (`timestamptz`, `uuid`, `time`, `fixed`, nanosecond timestamps, v3-only types) are refused: create such
  tables with this library through Glue instead. Athena creates format v2, assigns its own field IDs, and makes
  every column optional.
- Typed properties: `vacuum_max_snapshot_age_seconds`, `vacuum_min_snapshots_to_keep`,
  `vacuum_max_metadata_files_to_keep`, `optimize_rewrite_data_file_threshold`,
  `optimize_rewrite_delete_file_threshold`, `format`, `write_compression`, `write_target_data_file_size_bytes`.
- The runner polls `GetQueryExecution` with doubling backoff, reads every `GetQueryResults` page and drops the header
  row of SELECT results; failures raise `AthenaQueryFailedException` with Athena's reason.

- A query's (statement type DML) first result row is the header and is dropped; DDL and UTILITY results (`SHOW`,
  `DESCRIBE`) have no header, so their rows are kept as they are.

The regression suite's `AthenaTests` (AWS mode only) run through `AthenaQueryRunner`, with DDL from `AthenaSql`; they
skip without an AWS target and are where Athena-written fixtures will come from.

### Athena's SQL on Trino, and the Trino dialect

Athena engine v3 is Trino, so its stand-in here is Trino 478 (`emulation/up.sh --trino`, Iceberg
catalog `iceberg` over the REST fixture and moto S3). `AthenaSqlOnTrinoTests` names tables
`new AthenaTable(ns, name, Catalog: "iceberg")` and runs the generated SQL on tables this library writes:

| Statement | On Trino 478 |
|---|---|
| `Select` (column lists, quoted hyphenated names, `String` literals with quotes, `Timestamp` literals in WHERE) | ✅ same rows as this library |
| `AsOfVersion(snapshotId)` / `AsOf(instant)` (`FOR VERSION / TIMESTAMP AS OF`) | ✅ same rows as this library at that snapshot; the instant just before a commit gives the previous snapshot. Trino refuses an instant in the future |
| `MetadataTable`: `$snapshots`, `$history`, `$files`, `$manifests`, `$partitions`, `$refs` | ✅ agree with our metadata (snapshot IDs, snapshot log, data files and record counts, manifests, partitions, `main`) |
| `CreateTable`, `SetTableProperties`, `UnsetTableProperties` (Hive DDL, back-quotes, `TBLPROPERTIES`) | ❌ Athena only: Trino's parser refuses them (`SYNTAX_ERROR`) |
| `Optimize` (`OPTIMIZE … REWRITE DATA USING BIN_PACK`), `Vacuum` | ❌ Athena only (`SYNTAX_ERROR`) |

`TrinoSql` writes the Trino form of the Athena-only statements, all run in the same test class and checked by reading
the table back:

```csharp
var t = new AthenaTable("analytics", "events", Catalog: "iceberg");
TrinoSql.CreateTable(t, schema, spec, "s3://lake/analytics/events", formatVersion: 2);
// CREATE TABLE "iceberg"."analytics"."events" ("id" bigint, …) WITH (format_version = 2,
//   partitioning = ARRAY['day("event_ts")', 'bucket("id", 16)'], location = 's3://…')
TrinoSql.Optimize(t, fileSizeThresholdBytes: 128L << 20);   // ALTER TABLE … EXECUTE optimize(file_size_threshold => '134217728B')
TrinoSql.Vacuum(t, TimeSpan.FromDays(7));                   // EXECUTE expire_snapshots(…), then EXECUTE remove_orphan_files(…)
```

- Types: `timestamptz` → `timestamp(6) with time zone`, `uuid`, `time(6)` and nested `row(…)` / `array(…)` /
  `map(…)` are creatable in Trino (unlike Athena); `fixed`, nanosecond timestamps and v3-only types are refused.
  Trino folds names to lower case, so names with upper-case letters are refused. Trino makes every column optional
  and assigns its own field IDs; names, types, docs, location and the partition spec come through (checked).
- `optimize` takes a `WHERE` only on identity partition columns (Trino fails other predicates); Athena's
  `OPTIMIZE … WHERE` is likewise meant for partition columns.
- `expire_snapshots` / `remove_orphan_files` refuse a retention under 7 days unless the session lowers
  `iceberg.expire_snapshots_min_retention` / `iceberg.remove_orphan_files_min_retention`; Athena's `VACUUM` reads
  the `vacuum_*` table properties instead.

### The runner against moto

`AthenaRunnerEmulationTests` run `AthenaQueryRunner` with the real SDK client against moto's Athena, which records
queries but executes nothing: results are queued through `/moto-api/static/athena/query-results` (with Athena's
header row and NULL cells), and moto's state manager steps executions through `QUEUED → RUNNING → SUCCEEDED` (moto,
like Athena, refuses `GetQueryResults` before `SUCCEEDED`). Checked: the query, workgroup, catalog/database and
output location as moto received them; 2 500 rows read across three 1000-row pages (moto shim 3, see
[emulation.md](emulation.md)); the CSV moto writes to the output location; `OPTIMIZE`/`VACUUM` finishing with no rows;
a stopped query raising `AthenaQueryFailedException` with `CANCELLED`.

## DuckDB oracle

DuckDB's `iceberg` extension is not bundled with the `duckdb` wheel or DuckDB.NET; DuckDB downloads it from
`extensions.duckdb.org` on first use. `interop/duckdb_oracle.py` tries, in order: `LOAD` (already installed),
`INSTALL` (CI), and the `duckdb-extension-iceberg` / `duckdb-extension-avro` wheels (community repackaging of DuckDB's
signed builds; DuckDB verifies the signature on `LOAD`, so they cannot smuggle in a modified binary). The extension
needs `avro` for manifests.

```sh
uv sync --project interop --group duckdb                        # duckdb 1.5.5
# offline (no extensions.duckdb.org), additionally:
uv pip install --python interop/.venv/bin/python duckdb-extensions==1.5.5 duckdb-extension-iceberg==1.5.5 duckdb-extension-avro==1.5.5
ICEBERG_DUCKDB_PYTHON=interop/.venv/bin/python dotnet test tests/Iceberg.Net.Ecosystem.Tests --filter DuckDb
```

`DuckDbCrossEngineTests` writes tables with inserts, an upsert and a delete under copy-on-write, v2 position
deletes, v2 equality deletes and v3 deletion vectors, and checks DuckDB 1.5.5 reads the same rows; all four agree.
Without a usable Python or extension the tests skip with the reason; CI sets `ICEBERG_DUCKDB_REQUIRED=1`, so there a
load failure fails. DuckDB.NET was not used: it would need the same extension download, and the Python oracle keeps
all oracles in one environment.
