# DuckLake (`Iceberg.Net.DuckLake`)

A C# implementation of the [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/docs/stable/specification/introduction) table
format (1.0 and 1.1), built inside this repository on the Iceberg data plane and held to the same rules as the Iceberg code.

**Status:** evaluation build-out. It reads and writes lakes that DuckDB's `ducklake` extension (the reference
implementation) reads and writes, verified in both directions by cross-engine tests. Not packed or published
(`IsPackable=false`); the API is not settled. The catalog layer is EF Core on SQLite and PostgreSQL, both tested
against DuckDB, and both format versions are read and written.

## Usage

```csharp
using Iceberg.Net.DuckLake;
using Iceberg.Net.Expressions;
using Iceberg.Net.IO;

var store = DuckLakeStore.Sqlite("Data Source=lake/catalog.sqlite");          // or DuckLakeStore.PostgreSql("Host=…")
var lake = await DuckLakeCatalog.CreateAsync(store, new LocalFileIO(), "lake/data/");   // or OpenAsync(store, io)

await using (var tx = lake.BeginTransaction(author: "etl", commitMessage: "load"))
{
    await tx.CreateTableAsync("main", "events",
        [new("id", DuckLakeType.Int64, Nullable: false), new("tags", DuckLakeType.List(DuckLakeType.Varchar))]);
    await tx.InsertAsync("main", "events", [[1L, new[] { "a" }], [2L, null]]);
    await tx.CommitAsync();                       // one snapshot
}
await using (var tx = lake.BeginTransaction())
{
    await tx.DeleteAsync("main", "events", Expr.Equal("id", 2L));
    await tx.CommitAsync();
}
var table = await lake.LoadTableAsync("main", "events");                 // latest, or snapshotId: n
var rows = await lake.ReadAsync(table, Expr.GreaterThan("id", 0L));      // pruned by file statistics, filtered exactly
await foreach (var e in lake.ReadAsync<Event>(table)) { }                 // record Event(long Id, List<object?>? Tags)
await DuckLakeValidator.AssertValidAsync(lake);                         // the catalog's invariants hold
```

`ReadAsync` returns each type's physical value (an `int` of days for a date, `long` microseconds for a timestamp, as
the Iceberg data plane holds them); `ReadClrAsync` and `ReadAsync<T>` give natural CLR values (`DateOnly`,
`DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `decimal`, `ulong`, …; see `DuckLakeClr`), the latter bound to a record or class by
column name (`customer_name` ↔ `CustomerName`). Inserts accept either form.

DuckDB opens the same lake with `ATTACH '<store.DuckDbAttach()>' AS lake` (`ducklake:sqlite:lake/catalog.sqlite` or
`ducklake:postgres:dbname=… host=…`). A longer walk-through (nested types, partitioning, UPDATE, schema evolution,
time travel) is `examples/DuckLake.Quickstart`:

```bash
dotnet run --project examples/DuckLake.Quickstart [directory] [postgres connection string]
```

## What works

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Catalog | Creates the catalog (matching DuckDB's schema for SQLite and PostgreSQL exactly, per format version) with snapshot 0 and schema `main`, or opens an existing 1.0 or 1.1 catalog. EF Core over SQLite or PostgreSQL |
| Reads | Snapshot-scoped catalog queries (spec "Queries"), relative/absolute path chains, nested schemas (1.1), delete files, inlined rows (primitive and nested), inlined deletions, DuckDB's partial (merged/flushed) data and delete files with per-row snapshots, row IDs, time travel by snapshot or timestamp |
| Pruning | File statistics through the Iceberg metrics evaluator; Parquet row groups through footer statistics; exact residual filter |
| Writes | CREATE/DROP SCHEMA (nested in 1.1), CREATE/DROP TABLE, INSERT (file, file and table statistics, row IDs), DELETE (merge-on-read; a replacement delete file per data file, emptied files removed), UPDATE (delete + insert in one snapshot; the new versions keep their row IDs in `_ducklake_internal_row_id`, as the spec allows and DuckDB does), ADD/DROP/RENAME COLUMN, type widening (and `null` promotion), partitioned inserts, author/message/extra info |
| Types | `boolean`, `int8`–`int64`, `uint8`–`uint64`, `float32/64`, `decimal(p,s)`, `date`, `time`, `timetz`, `timestamp`, `timestamp_s`, `timestamp_ms`, `timestamptz`, `timestamp_ns`, `interval`, `varchar`, `json`, `blob`, `uuid`, `list`, `struct`, `map`, and 1.1's `null` (see [Types](ducklake/compatibility.md#types)) |
| Concurrency | Optimistic commits: on a lost race for the snapshot ID, the `changes_made` of every snapshot since the base are checked against the spec's logical conflicts, then the metadata is retried without rewriting files; delete-vs-delete is decided per data file. Transient database failures (SQLite `BUSY`, PostgreSQL `40001`) are retried, and a commit whose acknowledgement was lost is recognised by its snapshot's idempotency token rather than applied twice. Tested with concurrent writers on both databases, with DuckDB writing in between, and under injected catalog faults (see [Testing](ducklake/testing.md#catalog-database-faults)) |
| Catalog objects | Tags and comments (tables, columns and nested fields, views; view columns in 1.1), table renames, views, scalar and table macros, sort orders (written files follow the leading column keys); DuckDB uses each, and this library reads DuckDB's (see [Catalog objects](ducklake/operations.md#catalog-objects)) |
| Maintenance | Merging adjacent small files into partial files, rewriting files with many deleted rows, expiring snapshots, deleting scheduled and orphaned files; DuckDB reads the results and cleans up after them, and the reverse (see [Maintenance](ducklake/operations.md#maintenance)) |
| Existing files | `AddDataFilesAsync` registers Parquet files written elsewhere, in place, under a `map_by_name` column mapping with footer statistics, as `ducklake_add_data_files` does (Hive partition columns, missing and extra columns); files DuckDB added are read through their mapping (see [Adding existing files](ducklake/operations.md#adding-existing-files)) |
| Deletion vectors (1.1) | Puffin delete files read (bare `deletion-vector-v1` blobs, and containers of cumulative vectors keyed by `ducklake-snapshot-id`, the latest not after the scanned snapshot); written as bare vectors when `write_deletion_vectors` is set in the lake or `DuckLakeOptions.WriteDeletionVectors` is on |
| Encryption | Encrypted lakes (`DuckLakeOptions.Encrypted`, or an existing lake's `encrypted` setting): every Parquet data and delete file written with Parquet modular encryption (AES-GCM, encrypted footer) under a fresh 256-bit key per write, kept Base64 in `encryption_key` as DuckDB keeps it; DuckDB reads these lakes and writes to them, and this library reads DuckDB's. DuckDB cannot yet filter, delete from or update files encrypted here (a DuckDB bug with parquet-cpp's encryption; see [the differences table](ducklake/compatibility.md#where-the-reference-implementation-and-the-spec-differ)). Existing files cannot be added to an encrypted lake |
| Validation | `DuckLakeValidator` checks a whole lake (any writer's) and reports problems; `Deep` also reads every live file |
| Hostile catalogs | Paths, names, inlined-table names and keys from catalog rows are checked before use; deletion stays inside `data_path` (see [Security](ducklake/testing.md#security)) |
| Storage | Local disk and S3 (`S3FileIO`), both tested (see [Testing](ducklake/testing.md#tests)) |

## What is not implemented

`variant` and `geometry`, `int128`/`uint128` (DuckDB writes them to Parquet as DOUBLE and cannot read
them back), `time_ns` (DuckDB cannot write it to Parquet), inlining into partitioned tables (their small inserts go to files), and
catalog migration (1.0 → 1.1 is DuckDB's). Each fails with `NotSupportedException` when met in a catalog
or file rather than reading wrong values. The same list is in `tools/spec_trace.py` (`NOT_IMPLEMENTED`).

Within a transaction, a delete must be the first data operation on its table, and a table created in the transaction
cannot be altered in it (define its columns at creation).

## Next steps

1. Typed rows through the LINQ layer's mapping, shared with the Iceberg tables.
2. Write `INT(8)`/`INT(16)` annotations in Iceberg.Net.Data.
3. An API review, then a named consumer, before graduation.
